    <h2>How Olive Harvest Looks Like?</h2>
    <p>Each year on November we have one week off from school so we can go with our families to the harvest.
      On that week we used to wake up every day and dress up our clothes for the harvest by 7:00 am my grandma will be outside 
      with my aunts, cousins, and uncles. We ride that white Truck I used to sit on the back. You cannnot imagine how that day goes
      especially after brathing that fresh air. 
    </p>
    <p>Once we arrive to the land we start spreadin the mattresses around the trees we will start on. Then we split into groups,
      one work on the trees and the others collecting the olives that went to the ground. Then after finishing 3 to 4 trees we go and start preparing
      the breakfats we usually made a tomsto at the fire we made from the trees. Then we go back to wrok, once we finsh half of the trees we start preparing
      the lunch also on the fire we made including coffee and tea. Once we done we collect all our stuff and we wait for the truck to come back and take us.
      Of course I set with my uncle Shalee and my cousins and we start singing the old song that our old grandma's used to sing.
