    <h2>Olives in Palestinian crafts</h2>
     <p class="description">Palestinians use olive wood, which is the primary material for making wood products, and for making handicrafts, which depend on acquiring purely manual skills such as engraving and manufacturing, as the worker begins training since childhood. 
      This is because this craft requires training for a long period, and the history of this craft goes back to the period of the entry of Christian missionaries into the city of Bethlehem, which began with the manufacture of rosaries using olive seeds. 
      After that, the shape of each rosary developed, and each region specialized in producing a specific thing, for example: Beit Jala produces horses and camels, while Beit Sahour produces religious statues, while Bethlehem is famous for
      producing wooden utensils and cups.</p>
