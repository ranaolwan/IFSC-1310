    <h2>Steadfast as Olive Trees</h2>
    <p>Olive tree cultivation began in the region thousands of years ago. Where finds dating back to the Copper Age were 
      found indicating many olive groves and pressing methods for producing oil, specifically between 3600 BC and 3300 BC. Olives 
      became a trade commodity in the Bronze Age, as the shipwreck of Uluburun, which was found off the Turkish coast, is believed 
      to have carried olives brought from Palestine.</p>

    <p>Pruning rejuvenation of large olive trees.The olive tree is important in the region's three major religions - Judaism, 
      Christianity and Islam - with the Hebrew scriptures referring to olives as a symbol of prosperity, and as part of the 
      blessings of the Promised Land, and the Mount of Olives was considered of great importance in the New Testament. Olive oil 
      has been used for anointing as part of religious practices in Christianity and as a treatment referred to in Islam.
    </p>

    <p>
      Olive cultivation developed in the area surrounding the city of Nablus between 1700 and 1900 to become a major center of 
      production, and the extracted oil was used as an alternative to money. The oil was stored in deep wells in the city and its 
      surrounding villages to be used as a means of payment among merchants. The use of olives as an alternative to money increased
      by the nineteenth century, and the area of olive groves in historic Palestine reached about 475,000 dunums (about 47,500 hectares 
      or 112,000 acres), in 1914.
    </p>

    <p>Exporting olive oil extracted from olive orchards surrounding Nablus in the late Ottoman era before World War I became difficult 
      due to the high acidity of the oil, which causes a decrease in quality, and also due to the short shelf life and high prices. 
      This decline was followed by a doubling of production during the twenty-eight years that Palestine spent under the authority 
      of the British Mandate.
