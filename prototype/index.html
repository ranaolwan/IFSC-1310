            <h2>Where it Began</h2>

            <p>My name is Rana Olwan. I am Palestinian and American girl. I graduated from Mills University Studies High School in 
                Little Rock, AR. I am 19 years old. I am student at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock majoring in Computer Science 
                and I want to become Web Developer in the Future. I will share a little bit about my story and the accompleshments I did 
                since I was little until now. </p>

            <p>I grew up with my mom's family when my dad traveled. My mom is the reason for making me strong enough to go through this Life
               They tought me what does life, love, success, respect, and kindeness means. Life was not easy for us. Going to school everyday
               I have to listen how other girls waiting their dads to dinner and whenver they had conflict or they are sick theis dads came
               and took them while I amsitting aside have nothing to say about my dad. I just see him behined the screen for 20 to 30 minutes
               every once in a while, but on the other hand I was the only one who dressed well and living better than them. My dad's motivation
               and support encourage me to move on and be at the head of my classes each year. I knew he will happy from that so I did it.
               "It is dad!!" It was the first time I saw my dad on 2013 during the winter and it was snowing that day. It was starnge feeling
               but at the same time happy that my dad is here.</p>

            <p> I graduated from my Middle School on the first place and was the graduation speaker on that day. My performancce and support
                I had from my familt encouraged me that on High School I'll do my best. My old High School used to be from 5th until 12th grade.
                I studyed a lot and I make it through 9th grade with all A's and hnors. The story began when I started my 9th grade when I participated
                in the AI Competition around the world. I made an application using AI which decide based on the data I collected it if the person
                have Flatfoot or not. I was the leader and made it with mmy teem. We got the 5th palce at the Directory of Education of my city.
                That was the beganing of the story. </p>


            <h3 id="success"> The beganing of Success </h3>

            <p>After starting my 9th grade all my teacher were imparesseed by my note books and the way I use to memorize using <strong>mindmap</strong>.
                Everyone want to take my notebooks and kept it with them. I always showed respect to my teachers and I loved all of them. 
                When I started to engage with the life at the city I changed I lot. The way I speak and act. I used to go and school and then
                when we finish staright to home. Nothing else just studying. Seeing the life at the city improved my personality especially
                with speaking. From there anything comes to school specifically about technology the call me to see if I want to represent
                our school from there my journey starts.<strong>I did participte on:</strong> </p>

                <ol>
                    <li><em>STEM Field</em>
                        <ul>
                            <li>STEM Summer Camp</li>
                            </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Technology Field</em>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Girls in Tech</li>
                            <li>Girls in Technology International Day</li>
                            <li>Programming Course Learning Paython</li>
                            <li>Course of Understand the Concepts of AI </li>
                            <li>Competiton of best educational film</li>
                            </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Medicine Feild</em>
                        <ul>
                            <li>CPR Training</li>
                            <li>School Emergnecy Team</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p> That was until the pendamic starts. School closed. My cermony cancled and I missed the opportunity to travel Europe 
                    because of the pendamic. I got many certificates until that time honoring my dedcation at my school and outside it.
                </p>

            <h4> Moving to the United States</h4>

            <p>Now it is time to leave with my dad, but you know what is hurting that my mom is not part of that! I left her back home,
                coming with my dad without knowing what is waiting for me. Now I am responsiable about both my education and my brother's. Also,
                taking care of a house. That was stressful which cause me to get up, force everything and be the stringest.</p>
            
            <p> I entered high school here and showed myself as honor student until my graduation which I was the <em>salutatorian</em> at that time.
                I have been invited to <em>Arkansas Governors Mansion</em> representing my school there.I graduated and then I started my college 
                in the Fall of 2022. I showed myself there as well and make it until today.</p>
